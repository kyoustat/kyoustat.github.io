= A list of packages developed
{{<script>document.title = "Kisung::Software"</script>}}

I maintain and develop following packages in [https://www.r-project.org/ R]. Most of these are designed for computational efficiency \n
using [http://www.rcpp.org/ Rcpp] and its extensions, yet not fully optimized with decent performance on local machines.
