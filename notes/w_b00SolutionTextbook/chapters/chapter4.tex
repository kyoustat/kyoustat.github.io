% Problem 1.
\begin{exer}
From a population of size $N$ a simple random sample of size $n$ is drawn \textit{without replacement}, and a real-valued characteristic $X$ measured to yield observations $X_j~(j=1,2,\ldots,n)$. Show that
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item 
	The way we deal
	\item the expected squared error of $\bar{X}$ as an estimator of $m$, i.e., the variance of $\bar{X}$, is smaller than that of the mean of a simple random sample of the same size $n$ drawn \textit{with replacement}, and
	\item the difference between the expected squared errors of the two estimators is $O(n/N)$, as $n/N$ goes to zero.
\end{enumerate}
